Project Readme
This project is part of the requirement for completing the full-stack development program at Flatiron School.  It is a React application that allows users to select which cities they wish to travel to. An added feature of the app allows users to add cities that are currently not part of the list.  When users have all their preferred cities displayed in their own individual cards, users can then select and de-select cities as they wish.  Lastly, it uses React Router as a navigational tool between the home page and the Destinations page.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

React
